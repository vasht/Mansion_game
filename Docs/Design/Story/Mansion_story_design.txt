MANSION - STORY DESIGN



09.09.2017
-The mansion is in a secluded area at the outskirts of a forest or something like
that.
-The mansion belonged to Mr. Xor (think of name later), an evil man that enjoyed 
capturing and torturing people for fun. (Great hobby)
	-This plays into my theory of demons giving people thoughts, encouraging them
	to do bad things to others.
		-He was totally susceptible to that.
-The man was either caught or died for some reason and his mansion has been untouched 
ever since then. 
	-This is why you can still find items in there. Kids also didn't break in and
	steal stuff or vandalize the place because it's in a secluded area.
	-The mansion is supposed to look like it's been deserted for about 50 years.
