PROGRAM STRUCTURE - DESIGN

-The controllers are created in a static init function in the Controller
class
	-This function is called by the Mansion_game's init function

-The controllers are stored as static variables in the Controller class
	-There will be a variable pointing to the gameplayController,
	one pointing to the menuController and one pointing to
	whichever controller is active at the moment

-The Mansion_game has a pause() method
	-This method invokes the static function Controller.setController("menuController")
	to set the menu controller to be the active controller
	

-The Mansion_game has a loadLevel(levelName:String) method,
that loads the scene with the given name
	-This function also invokes the static function 
	Controller.setController("gameplayController") to	
	set the controller to the gameplay one

-There's an Updater class that calls an update function in each
class and instance that needs it, on every frame
	-It has an onEnterFrame event listener to execute the 
	update function on each frame
	-The update function calls an update function in each
	class and instance necessary

-There's a GameObject class that contains a tags property, of type Tags
	-MovingObject extends GameObject
