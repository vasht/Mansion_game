MANSION GAME - PROGRAM STRUCTURE DESIGN




-This class uses the Singleton pattern, as there should
only be one instance of the game running at any given time.
	-This also makes it easy for classes that extend
	MovieClip and that are added in the authoring tool
	to get a reference to the Mansion_game instance.

theInstance:Mansion_game
