WHY

-I've previously had an idea for a creepy game set in an old mansion. I thought it would be in 3D 
first persion view. You would explore the mansion, which would progressively have more and more
supernatural events occurring around you. It would also have random events, that you may or may 
not be around to witness. You also might miss some of them if you don't happen to be looking
in that direction.
-So I thought today that it might be a good idea to create a similar game, but in 2D, for practice.
I could post it on Newgrounds and get feedback to learn about what I do well and what I could do better.
	-This would also be a less complicated game to make than a Sonic game, because it relies less
	on physics and fast movement. This also makes it a good game to practice with.
	-I can work on collision detection in this situation which is easier to deal with to get the
	basics right. It should help me when I'm working on something more complicated, like a Sonic
	game.
	-You gotta learn to crawl before you can learn to walk.
	-This way I also get practice with receiving feedback and reacting to it. I'd learn to
	fix the things people find problematic, and I'd learn to filter good feedback from bad
	feedback.
