IDEAS



STORY


Short version:

-Here I want to give a short version of the story, to see if it works
from a bird's eye view so to speak. What I mean by that is, do the
main components of the story work well together?
-The point here is to be short, without much detail.
	-The premise, main revelations (about mansion, events and the
	main character) and the ending
