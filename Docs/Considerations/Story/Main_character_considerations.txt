-Should the main character be a girl or a guy?
	-For some reason I feel like making it a girl...
		-Is that too cliché?

-Why did this specifically happen to her?
	-Did the demons specifically choose her for some reason?
	-Did something happen to her that caused her to be the victim?
		-E.g. meeting a psychic, coming across a cursed item etc.
			-Ugh...
