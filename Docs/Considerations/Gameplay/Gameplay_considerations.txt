GAMEPLAY - CONSIDERATIONS

-When do you find the flash light?
	-Can there be cool game play if it takes a while to find the flash
	light? Or should you find it like, in one of the first three rooms
	or something?
	-Should you maybe find matches and possibly candles in the lobby first? And then a bit
	later the flash light?
		-How much do matches or candles light a room up?
			-Test this with actual matches and candles

-What room are you in when the game starts?

Option 1:
-The lobby
	-Obvious choice. It would also make sense if lost her memories as
	soon as she entered the mansion.
	-This choice feels more safe for the player. The lobby is a big 
	space, and probably wont feel too scary for the player. It could 
	also be a nice place to return to for a break from the oppressiveness
	of other areas.
		-The area that feels comforting doesn't have to be the lobby.
		But I do kind of like the idea that the lobby is a comforting
		area. That gives you a nice place from which to ease into
		the creepiness/oppressiveness of other areas.
		-There could be more comforting areas elsewhere in the game,
		for pacing purposes.
-I like this option so far. I might still think of something else though.

Option 2:
-Any side room near the lobby.
	-Anywhere besides the entrance has the additional creepiness factor
	of How did she end up in there? Did someone/something control her?
	Or was she voluntarily spending time in that room, when something
	bad happened?
