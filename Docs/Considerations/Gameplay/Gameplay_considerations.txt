GAMEPLAY - CONSIDERATIONS

-What room are you in when the game starts?

Option 1:
-The lobby
	-Obvious choice. It would also make sense if lost her memories as
	soon as she entered the mansion.
	-This choice feels more safe for the player. The lobby is a big 
	space, and probably wont feel too scary for the player. It could 
	also be a nice place to return to for a break from the oppressiveness
	of other areas.
		-The area that feels comforting doesn't have to be the lobby.
		But I do kind of like the idea that the lobby is a comforting
		area. That gives you a nice place from which to ease into
		the creepiness/oppressiveness of other areas.
		-There could be more comforting areas elsewhere in the game,
		for pacing purposes.
-I like this option so far. I might still think of something else though.

Option 2:
-Any side room near the lobby.
	-Anywhere besides the entrance has the additional creepiness factor
	of How did she end up in there? Did someone/something control her?
	Or was she voluntarily spending time in that room, when something
	bad happened?
