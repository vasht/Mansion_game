COLLISION DETECTION - CONSIDERATIONS


07.10.2017
-How do I make sure one solid object doesn't end up inside of another one?
Problem is, even if I check if the edges of two rotated rectangles are touching,
the result is still not correct if one of the rectangles is completely inside
the other one. In that case there are no colliding edges.

Option 1:
-Break each rectangle collider up into smaller rectangle colliders, to make it
less likely anything can completely fit inside it.
	-Sounds like a lot of work... 
	-If something is small enough, it still won't be registered.

Option 2:
-Check on which side of the edges the smaller rectangle is compared to the bigger
one.

-This actually might not matter, I should return to it if I notice it being a problem.
Or if I actually get far and people try it and find it buggy.
