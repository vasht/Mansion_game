PROGRAM STRUCTURE - TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS






06.02.2018
-For some reason, aligning a vertical line with the right edge of 
a circle makes the game stop checking for collisions at least
with that line and the circle from that point on. This doesn't,
however, happen if aligning a line with the left edge of the circle.
If you do it with the right edge, it only checks again if the rectangle
moves. But if you do it with the left edge, it keeps checking, even
if the rectangle doesn't move.
Why?

-Where should classes like Collider, RectangleCollider, CircleCollider, Vector_2D and ColliderPoint be stored? Code? Code.Geometry? 
Somewhere else?
