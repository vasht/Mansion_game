PROGRAM STRUCTURE - TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS

-In the function pointInRectangle I'm trying to deduce whether or not
a point is inside of a rectangle. To do that, I'm calculating a vector
p4, aligned with the rectangle and a vector p5, from the bottom left
corner of the rectangle to the given point p. I have calculated the
angle between p4 and p5, but the problem is my calculation only gives
the angle, but not whether it is clockwise or counter-clockwise.
	-As a result it is impossible to tell on which side of the
	rectangle edge the point is.

Option 1:
	-One option is finding a way to tell if the angle is clockwise or
	counter-clockwise and using that to give x' and y' the correct
	values.
	-How do I do that?
