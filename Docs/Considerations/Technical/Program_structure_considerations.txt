-Where should the colliders be initialized?

Option 1:
-The classes that extend solid object could initialize their collider in their 
own constructors, to be whichever type they need (circle, rectangle)
	-Then the collider's constructor could set has_moved to false
	and initialize the rectangle using the collider points


-How do the colliders get a reference to the solid object that they belong to?

Option 1:
-Just give them a reference in the constructor. Easy.
