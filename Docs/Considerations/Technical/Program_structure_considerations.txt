PROGRAM STRUCTURE - TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS

-Which should be called first in the updater, Controller.activeController.update()
or CollisionDetector.getInstance().update()?

Option 1:

-How should the Collider be constructed?

Option 1:
-Make the Collider extend MovieClip. Then have a square- and circle-shaped 
movie clip in the library that have the class RectangleCollider and CircleCollider.
	-Then all you have to do is place them in a separate layer in whatever 
	SolidObject you want and resize and rotate them to match the object.
	-One issue is that then there's no easy way to get the corner points of the 
	RectangleCollider once it's rotated.

-How should I get the corner points of the RectangleCollider, once it has been rotated?

Option 1:
-I could have another class called ColliderPoint or PointClip or something, which
extends MovieClip, and once added in the authoring tool, will calculate its own
center in the constructor. It would store that point in a variable.
	-I could place four of these whenever there's a RectangleCollider,
	one for each corner, and one for CircleColliders, for the middle point.
-I get the points using the collider_point_mc instances, and use the getGlobalCoord() function
to get the coordinates of them
	-With those the point(s) it would either make a Rectangle or a Circle.
	Whichever it is is stored in a variable. 
		-Then this is used in the correct collision test function (collisionRectangles,
	collisionRectCirc, collisionCircles), in whatever function checks for collisions
		-That function would first check which type of pair of colliders it has

-What should the Rectangle class look like?

Option 1:
-Defined as one point, width, height and rotation
-The problem here is that each of the other points will have to be
re-calculated each time collision testing is performed on a RectangleCollider.
This especially sucks when the rectangle has a rotation. 

Option 2:
-Defined as four points
-One problem with this is that it doesn't make sure the points you give
actually make a rectangle.
	-But I can make sure of that on my own
	-You can even add tests if for some reason you want to make sure
-All four points would have to be re-calculated each time a RectangleCollider
moved
-But if they didn't move, you don't have to re-calculate the points. This
would work pretty well, since most RectangleColliders are in LevelObjects,
which are stationary.
	-So when it comes to performance, this would be better.
-This works even better considering that I can just place movie clips on the
corners and use them to get the coordinates. These are automatically repositioned
when the parent movie clip is rotated.
-So I guess the Rectangle should consist of four points!

-How do I initialize the collider instances to have the same size as a movie
clip I've added in the authoring tool?
