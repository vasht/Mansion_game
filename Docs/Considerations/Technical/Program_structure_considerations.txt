-I'm trying to check if one rectangle collider is completely inside of another
rectangle collider. This check is relevant when all pairs of edges have already
been checked for intersections, and none of them were intersecting.
-This isn't completely straight forward when at least one of the rectangles has
been rotated.
	-In this situation, if one vertex on one collider is inside of the other
	one, then all of them are, otherwise one of the edges would have been 
	intersecting another edge.
	-So we need to pick one vertex on one rectangle collider and check if it's
	inside the other rectangle collider. Then we need to do vice versa, in case
	the other rectangle happens to be the one inside the first one.
	-This check would be easier if we had the coordinates of the chosen vertex
	in a coordinate system that's aligned with the rectangle we're checking.
		-Then it would be easy to check if the coordinates of the vertex
		in such a coordinate system, are within the boundries of the
		rectangle.
-How?
