PROGRAM STRUCTURE - TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS

-Can SolidObjects be explicitly converted to DynamicObjects?
-Find out.


-Should SolidObject and DynamicObject be two separate classes?


-Should velocity be stored in the SolidObject class or
DynamicObject class?
-Solid objects were supposed to be objects that stay
stationary. That was kind of the whole point of making it a separate
class from the DynamicObject class.
	-The problem with that is what to do when a solid object
	needs to be moved?
	-Is there even a point in having SolidObject and DynamicObject
	as two separate classes?

Option 1:
-SolidObject class.

-Where should classes like Collider, RectangleCollider, Rectangle, Circle, CircleCollider, Vector_2D and ColliderPoint be stored? Code? Code.Geometry? 
Somewhere else?
