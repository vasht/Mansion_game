PROGRAM STRUCTURE - TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS

-I didn't get the localToGlobal() method to work in the collider points. So when I rotate
the rectangle collider, I don't have the correct coordinates of the corner points anymore.
How should I get the coordinates after rotating a rectangle collider?

Option 1:
-Figure out how to get localToGlobal() to work
	-Since it's a built in method, it's probably more optimized than me using trig
	to calculate the coordinates.
-I got this to work now, so I'll just use it. This is the simplest option.

Option 2:
-Use trigonometry and the rotation of the solid object to update the coordinates of the 
points.
