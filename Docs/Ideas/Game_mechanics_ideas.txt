GAME MECHANICS - IDEAS

-I thought it would be dark in the mansion, but you have a flash light that you can
point in any direction using the mouse.
-I thought you'd move the character using the WASD keys.
-I thought the game could have 'hidden' stats, like hope vs hopeless, joy vs sad,
fear vs safety, self-esteem vs self-hate, confidence vs insecurity
	-How to make these work, since many depend on each other?
	-There wouldn't be any kind of a gauge for these, but the value they're at
	would have visible and practical effects in the game world.
	-E.g. low stats in hope would make the game character say things like "I'm
	never going to get out of here...", or low stats in self-esteem could
	make her say stuff like "Why would anyone want me? I'm just ugly and useless..."
	-The character would walk and look different depending on her mood.
	-Does this affect dialogue?
	-At some points the game character could react differently depending on her mood.
