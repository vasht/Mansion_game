QUICK IDEAS



Here I can quickly dump ideas that come to me, just to get them written down.
Then I can later come back and move them to the sections they belong in and go over
if I want to implement them or not.

-A demon could lie and say that they'll help you if you give it some item
	-They might look like something neutral
		-They might be invisible
		-They might look like a statue
	-They might look like something creepy
		-A demon
	-They might look like something nice
		-Another girl
		-An adult
		-An animal
	-They might offer protection
	-They might offer a way out
	-They might offer power
	-They might offer access to a new area
	-They might offer a solution to a puzzle or problem in the game
	-If you do it the item disappears, but the demon never does anything good for you.
		-Might give themselves away imediately and make fun of you for being dumb
		-Might just disappear and never be seen again, at least not in the same form
			-Would be cool if it appeared again later though, looked different,
			but you could tell it's the same one by the way it talks
