QUICK IDEAS



Here I can quickly dump ideas that come to me, just to get them written down.
Then I can later come back and move them to the sections they belong in and go over
if I want to implement them or not.

-When you die, the game could restart you from the last point where you had full
health.
	-The game would save whenever you enter a room, pick up an item or use an
	item. And whenever anything else significant happens, like triggering events.
	-When you die, you would load with mood stats and items you had when you lost
	your full health, in the room where that happened, but at the entrance to the
	room. (The entrance you used to enter it)

-A room where you (for some reason) hear white noise for as long as you're in there
	-This would be effectively creepy (hopefully) because there would be low volume 
	voice samples that would play at random times.
		-They'd be at a low enough volume that you could be unsure if you heard 
		that or if you imagined it
		-This would train your ears to listen for random voices, and so when
		you hear white noise, you're more likely to hear voices in it, even
		though they're not there
	-The room would be designed to encourage you to stay for a while
		-There could be stuff to explore like drawers, cabinets, a chest etc.
		with stuff in them
		-There could be a note/some notes to read
		-This way you have to stay and hear the noise for a while, making it
		more likely you'll hear something in it

-Voices could sometimes randomly be heard at low volumes, saying something to put
down the main character or to make her feel scared
	-This would depend on a random timer, and would say something different
	depending on your location and how far you are in the game
	-They could say things like "It's hopeless" "You're going to die",
	"You're useless" "I've killed" etc

-There could be dialogue puzzles, with like 10 options to choose from that you can
say or respond. There would be one option in there that would be clever to say at 
that point, and that would allow you to gain some kind of insight to the demons
or the mansion.
	-The reason there's 10 options is so that the game doesn't so easily just
	give you the right thing to say. Hopefully it would make you actually have
	to think about what's smart to say in this situation.
		-Figuring it out would make the player feel pretty clever. c:
	-You could for example learn about if something one of the demons said was
	true or a lie, or you could learn something about the demon's abilities and
	limitations.
		-For example, the demons will tell you that they see everything and
		know everything that she does in the house. But if she tricks one,
		she might find out that that's not true.
			-For example she could say the demon in the X room told her
			this or that but she actually didn't see a demon in that room.
			Then if the demon she's talking to comments on that, but doesn't	
			deny that there was a demon in that room, she would know that they
			don't see her all the time.
	-Once you successfully trick them to give you info, does the player have the choice
	to tell the demon about their discovery?
		-No, Xanne automatically tells the demon, who gets furious and curses Xanne
		with lots of profanity and swearing. (Satisfying)
		-No, Xanne doesn't tell the demon.
		-Yes, you can then choose if you want to reveal that you tricked them.
			-Are there then pros and cons of each?
	-How does it help you to figure something out? It would be really cool if it actually
	made a differece to the game somehow.
		-Possibly you could have some option available to you later in the game
		that depends on the knowledge you have. A weakness of theirs to exploit,
		possibly a different ending.

-The demons of the house gradually get more and more power, being able to do more
powerful physical things to scare and hurt you. 
	-Doing clever things that make your character feel happier/more confident,
	decreases the amount of power that the demons have, by some amount.
-Demons can attempt to possess the main character
	-In these situations you have to mash some key on the keyboard
	-The more injured the character is, the more likely demons are to attempt
	possession, and the more likely they are to succeed
	-If you don't succeed in button-mashing fast enough, the demon takes over 
	and possesses the character
		-If you have the knife in your inventory, they will make the Xanne
		cut herself, or possibly stab herself in the stomach
		-They could also make her do something creepy at the same time, like
		make her laugh or say "I should die"
-The character could have a hidden weariness gauge, which depletes slowly with time
	-Once it's low, the character would start complaining about being sleepy
	-If you don't make her sleep in a bed, she'll eventually start saying stuff like
	"so tired..." or "Gotta hold my eyes open..."
		-She'll eventually just lay down and rest
	-You can also make her sleep on one of the beds in the house, or maybe a couch
	-The screen goes black. You see her eye lids open in a first persion view, and
	she's seeing the ceiling. You can see or hear her thoughts: "Something is on me...
	I can't move! Oh my god, what's happening? I'm trying to scream, but I can't make
	a sound... I feel a presence on me..."
	-Then all of a sudden the screen is back to over head view or whatever and you hear
	her screaming. After screaming for a few seconds, she's panting. Then she wonders,
	was that a dream? Or was there someone here just now?

-A demon could lie and say that they'll help you if you give it some item
	-They might look like something neutral
		-They might be invisible
		-They might look like a statue
	-They might look like something creepy
		-A demon
	-They might look like something nice
		-Another girl
		-An adult
		-An animal
	-They might offer protection
	-They might offer a way out
	-They might offer power
	-They might offer access to a new area
	-They might offer a solution to a puzzle or problem in the game
	-If you do it the item disappears, but the demon never does anything good for you.
		-Might give themselves away imediately and make fun of you for being dumb
		-Might just disappear and never be seen again, at least not in the same form
			-Would be cool if it appeared again later though, looked different,
			but you could tell it's the same one by the way it talks
