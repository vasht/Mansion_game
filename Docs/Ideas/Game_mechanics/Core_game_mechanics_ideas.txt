CORE MECHANICS - IDEAS



-Here I'd want to explore the core mechanics, that is the gameplay that actually 
progresses the game. It's also gameplay that is not optional.

Option 1:

-One option is that to be able to move on, you have to do things for your game
character to reach a high enough mood and confidence level.
	-For example in the beginning, before having a flash light, if you try
	to enter a dark room, she could say something like "I'm too scared to
	enter that room... :/". But once you do SOME STUFF, she'll say something	
	like "I think I'm ready to enter that dark room now..." or "I think I feel
	brave enough to enter that room now..."
	
	-What kind of things could you do that increase her confidence level?
	
	Option 1:
	-Going through less scary areas could increase her confidence to go through
	more scary areas. 
		-The character would always say something whenever she's confident
		enough to enter an area she was too scared to enter before.
		-This can't really be a core mechanic though, because then the game
		would just be about visiting different areas in the right order. -.-
	
	Option 2:
		-Inventory puzzles that ONLY increase the game character's confidence,
		but don't do anything else.
			-E.g. if you find a dress and use it in front of a mirror, the character
			would put it on and look at herself in the mirror. She would think
			it looks nice, and it would boost her confidence.
				-That sounds like a nice thing to have optional though...
			-Tryin some kind of skill that she doesn't know well.
				-The first time she might be like "I did such a bad job, man
				I suck..." and you might lose confidence. But the second time
				she would say something like "Meh, it's not great..." and
				lose just a little bit of confidence. Then the third time,	
				she would say "It's okay, I guess", and then the fourth time
				"Hey, that's not too bad!".
				-As you do it enough times, you would end up gaining more
				confidence than you lost initially.
			-If the demons have weaknesses, then using an item against one
			and defeating it, could increase her confidence.
			-Equipping: You could pick up something comforting, like a teddy bear.
			It would have an option to equip it, and at first glance it doesn't appear
			to do anything. It would, however, actually increase your confidence or decrease
			your loneliness level while wearing it. 
				-Might give access to some place earlier, or make some events
				easier to come across.
	-I don't really like the thought of this as a core mechanic so far, maybe as an optional thing.
	Might still turn out to become a core mechanic if I come up with more ways that you could increase
	her mood and confidence.

Option 2:

-Inventory puzzles
		-I feel like there would have to be a lot of items, for me to get into
		making inventory puzzles. This way it's not so obvious what the right item 
		is, compared to having 5 things in your inventory, and just going ahead and
		trying all of them.
			-If you have tons of items, you'll feel like thinking about what the
			right one to use is, rather than just trying a bunch.
			-Also, sometimes the necessary item might be something you picked up
			quite a while ago in the game, which also makes it less obvious what the
			right item is.
			-In this case I'd want to make it so that you can use all of the items somewhere
			and completely empty your inventory of useable items. Even if some of them
			didn't actually really do anything when used, but maybe get a cool comment 
			from the character.
			-I'm kinda digging this idea, although I'm not sure if it should be a core
			mechanic yet or not.
-I might actually go with this as the main core mechanic. I kind of like the idea of inventory
	puzzles, but I'd have to try to think of some to see if I'm able to come up with them. 

Option 3:

-Non-inventory puzzles. Including text puzzles, dialogue puzzles and "RE4" puzzles.
-I might wanna add text puzzles and dialogue puzzles as little extra things in the game,
but I don't want the game to focus on them. I don't like the idea of RE4-style puzzles
in this game.

Option 4:

-Boss fights with the demons. Each demon would have some kind of weakness that you have to figure out.
	-Physical fights, with weapons.
		-I don't want the game to have weapons...
	-Physical fights with some items you find, like pots, steel pipes, rocks, bottles etc.
	-"Boss fights", where you mostly avoid the demon's attacks, while trying to figure out
	its weakness.
-I'm not really digging this idea. I'd rather keep the game focused on the atmosphere. But
at the same time, I don't know if it'll get boring or repetitive without fights. I might have
to make sure the game isn't so long that stuff starts feeling repetitive or boring.
