CONTROLLER - TODO 



-Make it so pressing the WASD keys moves the character
-Make it so the readInput function registers which keys
are being pressed, and sets booleans to true on those
keys we care about
-Test that the readInput function is actually called when
pressing keys
-Make the init function register the readInput function
as a listener function to the event KEY_DOWN
