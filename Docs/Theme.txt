THEME 



09.09.2017
-The theme of the game, summarized to one sentence is this:
	"Don't give in to bad thoughts".


-The game symbolizes the bad thoughts people can have about themselves and their situation
and how it's good to resist thinking or focusing on those thoughts or feelings.
	-Thoughts about yourself:
		-For example, "I'm fat and ugly", "No one will ever love me", "I don't deserve
		to be loved", "Things will never get better"
		-Or even just feeling worried about wether things will never get better or always
		stay bad.
		-This is represented by Xanne and her struggle with believing that she will
		be okay and make it out of the creepy mansion and that she's competent or
		strong enough to do so.
	-Thoughts about others:
		-For example, "That person is useless", "That person is stupid", "I'm better than
		that person", "I'd love to just punch that person", "I'd love to kill that person".
		-This is represented by the sadistical Mr. Xor.


-The game is heavily inspired by the impression I got of the Christian notion of demons.
	-They were angels, but were cast from heaven when they rebelled.
		-As a result, they can't feel anything positive (love, joy) but only
		misery, negative emotions.
			-As a result of this, they are completely jealous of humans,
			who do get to feel positive emotions.
				-As a result of this, they want to cause humans as much
				torment and misery as possible.

-This game is inspired by a theory I've had on demons, although the game itself isn't supposed
to be religious.
	-The theory is that demons can give people thoughts, encouraging them to think or do
	what demons want them to think or do.
		-This game combines the two ways I theorize that demons use this:
			-They give people thoughts about hurting others, encouraging them to do horrible 
			things to other humans
				-I've got this idea from situations in history where people were able
				to do things to others of unspeakable evil.
					-WWII scientists and ghettos
					-Vietnam war torture "for information"
			-They give people bad thoughts about themselves, and encourage you to
			hurt yourself.

-The way these two kinds of influence are combined in this game is that Xanne is made to
feel bad about herself and her situation, whereas the previous tenant of the building
was influenced to start hurting and killing others.
